The random module in python

To use it you need to first import it 
> import raandom

random.randint(a, b)
Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. 

random.random()
Return the next random floating-point number in the range 0.0 <= X < 1.0

random.uniform(a, b)
Return a random floating-point number N such that a <= N <= b for a <= b and b <= N <= a for b < a.


Data structures
 
Lists
> fruits = [item1, item2]   # you can have mixed data types
        e.g = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]

> You can access items in the list counting from the end of the list by using negative whole numbers. 
e.g fruits = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]
    fruits[-1] #this will be "Pear"

> You can use the same syntax to get hold of items in a List to modify it. e.g.
    fruits[0] = "Orange"    # fruits will now become ["Orange", "Apple", "Pear"]
   
>You can add items to the end of a List using the append() function
e.g fruits = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]
    fruits.append("Orange")
# fruits will now become ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear", "Orange"]


> When you try to access an item that is not in the range of the List, you will get an IndexError
e.g fruits = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]
    print(fruits[3])    #This will be an IndexError

Nested list
> You can put Lists inside other Lists, this becomes something called a "Nested List" or a "2D List"
e.g fruits = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]
    veg = ["Cucumber", "Kale", "Spinnach"]
    fruits_and_veg = [fruits, veg]
    #The list would look like this: [["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"], ["Cucumber", "Kale", "Spinnach"]]

You could also represent the list in 2D format like this:
["Cherry", "Apple", "Pear"]
["Cucumber", "Kale", "Spinnach"]


You can get the length of a list (number of items in the list) or the length of a string (number characters in the string) by using the len() function.
